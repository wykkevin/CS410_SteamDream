Team Member: Xinyu Lian, Yu Zhang, Yuankai Wang, Yutao Zhou
## ðŸ“œ Overview
Our project does a sentiment analysis on steam game reviews. We are able to estimate the attitude of a game review and also whether the review can be helpful or funny. Our code can be mainly divided into three parts: dataset preprocessing, text  preprocessing, and model building.

## ðŸš¨ Prerequisites
1. Please download the [merged.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D89yWAHPI2MlvbG30W0WJ_ixC00dEuF2/view?usp=sharing) and upload it to google drive.
or download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smeeeow/steam-game-reviews) and process the file using `data_processing.ipynb` and `data_combination.ipynb`
2. Download the `Steam_review.ipynb` file and also upload it to google drive


## ðŸ”¥ Quick Start
